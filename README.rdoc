I don't want a bucket list like other people's. 

I don't want my existence to be focused on getting the most I can out of life. 

I want to try to give back before I kick that infamous bucket. So I am creating the Other Bucket. 

It's a place where I will store my best intentions to give back at a later time. I may not be able to give back as generously as I would like to, right at this moment. But later on, when I have more a) time, b) money, or c)influence, I'd like to do what I can to settle up.
